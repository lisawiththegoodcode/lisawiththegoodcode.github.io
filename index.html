    <p>
      Hello, I'm Lisa. I am a student at Austin Coding Academy.
      I am currently learning the skills it takes to become a professional full-stack developer by night, while working as a florist by day.
      As a florist, I am empowered to be creative, meticulous, knowledgable, and collaborative to make beautiful things.
      And I find so much satisfaction in this. My imagination loves this work. But I also feel like something's missing.
      You see, at my core, while I'm highly imaginative and inclined to create, I'm also an eager learner and relentless problem-solver.
      And I wish I had more opportunity to leverage these strengths on a daily basis.
      <br /><br />After conversations with a developer friend, I decided to give coding a try.
      I worked through online tutorial after online tutorial with glee; this way of thinking felt like a glove for my brain.
      So, I enrolled in a professional program to help me make the shift from florist to developer, and here I am, back in school and loving every minute of it.
      I will graduate in December 2018, and my goal is to attain a full-time position as junior-level developer after graduation.
      In the meantime, I would love to intern with your team or provide freelace support. Let's collaborate!
