      <h1>Lisa Umhey</h1>
      <h2>Web Developer  /  Florist</h2>
    <p>
      Hello, I'm Lisa. I am a student at Austin Coding Academy, learning HTML, CSS and Javascript.
      I am in the beginning stages of learning the skills it takes to become a full-stack developer.
      <!-- I recently became interested this career path after realizing I wasn't fully satisfied with the way I use my brain in my current work. -->
      I am also a florist. As a florist, I am empowered to be creative, meticulous, knowledgable, and collaborative to make beautiful things.
      And I find so much satisfaction in this. My imagination loves this work. But I also feel like something's missing.
      You see, at my core, while I'm highly imaginative and inclined to create, I'm also an eager learner and relentless problem-solver.
      And I wish I had more opportunity to leverage these strengths on a daily basis, without giving up the things I love about my current work.
      <br /><br />After conversations with a developer friend, I decided to give coding a try.
      I worked through online tutorial after online tutorial with glee; this way of thinking felt like a glove for my brain.
      I decided to find a professional program to help me make the shift from florist to developer, and here I am.
      Once I graduate in December 2018, my goal is to attain a position as a junior developer and continue my journey into the tech field.
      In the long-run, I am very inspired by the potential of AI and dream of using this technology to help improve people's lives.
      In the meantime, I would love to intern with your team or volunteer on your next passion project. Let's collaborate!
